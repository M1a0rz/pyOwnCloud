This code is in no way currently endorsed or\r\nsupported by ownCloud, all bugs should be reported here and not there.\r\n\r\nSupport/Discussion:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n* Use github for issues/patches/etc: https://github.com/csawyerYumaed/pyOwnCloud\r\n* For discussion use: http://lists.cknow.org/listinfo.cgi/pyowncloud-cknow.org (pyowncloud <@> lists.cknow.org)\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-------------\r\n* The ocsync C library from ownCloud. If you install Mirall, you get it for free on Linux.\r\n\tIf you don't want to install mirall, you can install the 'ocsync' binary package from the owncloud repo's.\r\n        So far we have successfully tested against 0.70.4 and 0.70.5 of the libocsync library.\r\n* Python > 2.6 < 3 (patches welcome)\r\n* An ownCloud server to sync with. (Presumably you already have one of these.)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-------------\r\n* standard python setup.py script.\r\n* It will create a new command called oclient, and you can call that :)\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nusage: just run oclient -h, and it will give you help.\r\n    \r\n    usage: oclient [-h] [-v] [-c [CONFIG]] [-u [USER]] [--ssl [SSLFINGERPRINT]]\r\n                   [-p [PASS]] [--dry-run] [--debug] [-s [SRC]] [-d [DST]]\r\n                   [--url [URL]] [--use-keyring]\r\n    \r\n    Synchronize files across machines using ownCloud DAV server.\r\n    \r\n    optional arguments:\r\n    -h, --help            Show this help message and exit\r\n    -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit\r\n    -c [CONFIG], --config [CONFIG]\r\n                          Configuration to use.\r\n    -u [USER], --user [USER]\r\n                          Username on server.\r\n    --ssl [SSLFINGERPRINT]\r\n                          SSL fingerprint on server to accept.\r\n    -p [PASS], --pass [PASS]\r\n                          Password on server. You can also store this in\r\n                          environment variable OCPASS.\r\n    --dry-run             Dry Run, do not actually execute command.\r\n    --debug               Print a bunch of debug info.\r\n    -s [SRC], --src [SRC]\r\n                          Local Directory to sync with.\r\n    -d [DST], --dst [DST]\r\n                          Folder on server.\r\n    --url [URL]           URL to sync to.\r\n    --use-keyring         use keyring if available to store password safely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n    oclient supports the ownCloud config file, which is located here:\r\n        $HOME/.local/share/data/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg\r\n    oclient only supports the 'ownCloud' section of the config.\r\n    oclient supports the following keys in the cfg  file:\r\n    \tuser: username on the ownCloud server\r\n    \tpass: password on the ownCloud server\r\n    \turl: url of the ownCloud server\r\n    \tsslfingerprint: valid SSL fingerprint for the server\r\n    \tsrc: local directory to sync against\r\n    \tdst: folder on the server to sync against\r\n    \r\n    complete example:\r\n    [ownCloud]\r\n    user=awesomeSauce\r\n    pass=PasswordThisIsSuperSuperSecretReallyISwearLOL\r\n    url=https://www.example.org/owncloud/\r\n    sslfingerprint=\r\n    src=/home/awesomeSauce/ownCloud\r\n    dst=clientsync\r\n    \r\n    Password options:\r\n     *) You can specify on the cmd line: -p (not very safe)\r\n     *) In the environment variable: OCPASS\r\n     *) In the owncloud.cfg file as pass = <password>\r\n     *) Do none of the above, and it will prompt you for the password.\r\n     *) Use keyring to store passwords in a keyring. (needs Python Keyring Lib to be installed)\r\n     \r\n     The choice is yours, if you put it in the cfg file, be careful to\r\n     make sure nobody but you can read the file. (0400/0600 file perms).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
